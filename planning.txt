Who's Alaa Eddine Ourmassi?
Hey, I'm Alaa Eddine Ourmassi,
 a Computer Science student at
 FSE of Sidi Bel Abbès in Algeria.
 My journey began in the summer of 2023
 with mobile development, and I have since
 transitioned into the web industry. I spend most
 of my time learning new technologies, aiming to
 visualize innovative apps and develop existing 
ones further. If you have any project ideas or want 
to collaborate, feel free to reach out through my contact

I’ve honed my skills and built a solid foundation. Here’s my toolbelt for success:

JavaScript (ES6+)
React
Flutter
Nodejs
MySql
MongoDB
Typescript
git

What i'm currently doing
I'm actively mastering Next.js while refining my expertise through hands-on web development projects.
